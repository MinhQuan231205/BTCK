Lets the `ItemsTable` component have customizable columns.

The logic for this is contained in `BaseItemsTable`. This is preliminary work for #41614

This doesn't introduce any new UI, but there is a unit test for the new logic.

The main thing to check is whether the table on the collections page stills work correctly. Note how the columns adjust as you resize the viewport horizontally. (In fact, the columns will sometimes adjust as you close and open the sidebar, because the width they are paying attention to is the width of the area to the right of the sidebar.)

Refactor the embedding api namespace to allow a bit of reuse between the embedding api and the embedding preview
api. In some cases, the implementations are not identical (in terms of the shape of data expected/endpoints
available), so this is a first step to making them the same.

* PoC Pivot table exporting.

Works so far!

This just hacks a couple things in. I added the :query via format_rows, which should instead have its own proper
middleware

Pivot export should probably not just be in the middleware namespace but in qp.pivot.

Should not break the streaming results writer for non-pivots... obviously this breaks ordinary results, so that needs
to be handled properly.

Better documentation about how the logic actually works. Pivot tables are hard to remember/easy to forget, so some
very clear diagrams/examples would probably be good.

* adjust csv export to export a pivot table when pivot options exist

* post processing of pivot table rows for card/dashcard downloads

* WIP on getting pivot exports to work with unsaved questions

* WIP getting pivot exports working on unsaved questions

The dataset POST /pivot endpoint is used to get the pivot data to the frontend, but also to get the pivot query.

The query that is returned by the POST comes from the json_query, which is populated by the userland-query stuff with
the last run query. The pivot qp runs mulitple queries and each query runs through the regular userland query qp, so
we'll 1. see lots of executions recorded and 2. end up with the wrong query in the POST return. It'll look mostly
correct, but due to how the pivot qp works won't necessarily have all of the fields.

That incorrect pivot query is passed to the /:export-format endpoint and we don't end up seeing correct results.

Since that json_query gets fed back to the backend when doing an export, we do need it to be correct, like the query
that was sent to /pivot in the first place.

Since this is a WIP, I've just passed the query as a string to :original-query in :info, and if that exists, use that
to fill the :json_query key.

Then, also add a :was-pivot flag so that the dataset download endpoint can look at it and use the pivot qp instead of
the regular qp. Even if we have the correct 'top level' query, we need to run it through the pivot qp to get the full,
correct pivoted results.

* Pivot Export Test

Here I've added a pivot export test that has various assertions trying to capture the correct output from the pivot
csv export.

I've done my best to explain the tests with comments, but have also left a (comment ) form with a function
`explore-pivot` to help *show* rather than tell what the expected pivot output should be.

I've created this new namespace to first capture this pivot export test with the intent to add tests that can improve
our confidence that ALL exports/downloads in ALL places behave as we expect in the future. It just seemed nice to
start fresh here with the pivot export test first.

* Don't need to make this public.

* Add lots of comments to hopefully make this a bit easier to follow

* Added an explore-raw-pivot fn in comment form

* Update test/metabase/api/downloads_exports_test.clj

* begin addressing feedback

- finish an unfinished docstring
- merge info instead of assoc
- use a native query to build the pivot data instead of using a custom dataset, to keep test speed ok

* Create a new ns for the pivot post processing utils

Separate the post processing fns into their own namespace. This means I can easily add a test namespace for the post
processing specifically as well.

* Add pivot postprocessing test ns, not complete, but decent start

* fix mistake in endpoint. Only add original query to first pivot q

* Figured out how to keep the original query without storing as a string

* Perhaps this'll fix things properly?

3 TODOs were removed here:

- ""a way to SET Database-local values."" More like TODONE :haaa:

- ""we should probably also bind this [that is, *database-local-values*]
in sync contexts e.g. functions in [[metabase.sync]]"" I think we don't
need to do this. The full set of maybe-database-local settings right now
is `aggregated-query-row-limit`, `unaggregated-query-row-limit`,
`database-enable-actions`, and `persist-models-enabled`. None of these
need to be set when `sync`ing. If at some point we do add a db-local
setting that should affect the way syncing works, we will need to do
this - but I don't think this TODO will help figure that out.

- ""settings sent via an env var aren't returned for security purposes.
It is an open question whether we should obfuscate them and still show
the last two characters like we do for sensitive values that are set via

qualifies as an ""open question."" We can reopen if down the road if this
is something we want."

* Correct Data Shape for Multi-Series Static Viz

Fixes: #41787

During the echarts migration, some backend tests needed fixing. In this process, the shape of data (eg. list of cards
and their data results from execution) were altered.

This was done to fix failing tests and renders for single series cards (all Questions and many dashcards), but didn't
correctly handle a multi-series card.

This conditionally adds back the expected shape.

Perhaps in a follow on PR it's worth inspecting the implementation of the :javascript_visualization render method to
clean it up. Probably worth putting some Malli schemas around it too to make it clearer what shape we need.

* Make sure card/data maps going into static-viz are distinct

* Add a test util to render dashcards, add multiseries card test

We haven't made a 'unit' (perhaps more like a small integration test at this point) test for multi series dashcards
yet.

In most other cases, making sure a card (Question) renders properly is sufficient, but the multi series dashcards are
a special case. It's probably useufl to have a test or two, and the dashcards test util should hopefully help future
test writing a bit now too."

* Migration to add `trashed_from_*` (#41529)

We want to record where things were trashed *from* for two purposes:

- first, we want to be able to put things back if they're ""untrashed"".

- second, we want to be able to enforce permissions *as if* something is
still in its previous location. That is, if we trash a card or a
dashboard from Collection A, the permissions of Collection A should
continue to apply to the card or dashboard (e.g. in terms of who can
view it).

To achieve this, collections get a `trashed_from_location` (paralleling
their `location`) and dashboards/cards get a
`trashed_from_collection_id` (paralleling their `collection_id`).

* Create the trash collection on startup (#41535)

* Create the trash collection on startup

The trash collection (and its descendants) can't have its permissions
modified.

Note that right now, it's possible to move the Trash collection. I'll
fix this when I implement the API for moving things to the Trash.

* s/TRASH_COLLECTION_ID/trash-collection-id/g

* Add a comment to explain null comparison

* Move archived items to the trash (#41543)

This PR is probably too big. Hopefully documenting all the changes made here will make it easier to review and digest. So:

Tables with a `collection_id` had `ON DELETE SET NULL` on the foreign key. Since we only deleted collections in testing and development, this didn't really affect anything. But now that we are actually deleting collections in production, it's important that nothing accidentally get moved to the root collection, which is what `SET NULL` actually does.

When we get an API request to update the `archived` flag on a card, collection, or dashboard, we either move the item *to* the trash (if `archived` is `true`) or *from* the trash (if `archived` is `false`). We set the `trashed_from_collection_id` flag as appropriate, and use it when restoring an item if possible.

Because moving something to the trash by itself would have permissions implications (since permissions are based on the parent collection) we need to change the way permissions are enforced for trashed items.

First, we change the definition of `perms-objects-set-for-parent-collection` so that it returns the permission set for the collection the object was *trashed from*, if it is archived.

Second, when listing objects inside the Trash itself, we need to check permissions to make sure the user can actually read the object - usually, of course, if you can read a collection you can read the contents, but this is not true for the trash so we need to check each one. In this case we're actually a little extra restrictive and only return objects the user can *write*. The reasoning here is that you only really want to browse the Trash to see things you could ""act on"" - unarchive or permanently delete. So there's no reason to show you things you only have read permissions on.

Because previously the Collections API expected archived collections to live anywhere, not just in a single tree based in the Trash, I needed to make some changes to some API endpoints.

This endpoint still takes an `exclude-archived` parameter, which defaults to `false`. When it's `false`, we return the entire tree including the Trash collection and archived children. When it's `true`, we exclude the Trash collection (and its subtree) from the results.

Previously, this endpoint took an `archived` parameter, which defaulted to `false`. Thus it would only return non-archived results. This is a problem, because we want the frontend to be able to ask for the contents of the Trash or an archived subcollection without explicitly asking for archived results. We just want to treat these like normal collections.

The change made to support this was to just default `archived` to the `archived` status of the collection itself. If you're asking for the items in an archived collection, you'll only get archived results. If you're asking for the items in a non-archived collection, you'll only get unarchived results.

This is, for normal collections, the same thing as just returning all results. But see the section on namespaced collections for details on why we needed this slightly awkward default.

No change - this endpoint still takes an `archived` parameter. When `archived=true`, we return the Trash collection, as it is in the root collection. Otherwise, we don't.

* Remove Archive Page + Add `/trash` routing (#42226)

* fixes unit + e2e tests, corrects links generated for trash collection to use /trash over /collect/:trashId route

* updates comment

* Serialize trash correctly (#42345)

Also, create the Trash in a migration rather than on startup. Don't set a specific trash collection.id, instead just select based on the `type` when necessary.

* Fix collection data for trashed items (#42284)

* Fix collection IDs for trashed items

When something is in the trash, we need to check permissions on the
`trashed_from_collection_id` rather than the `collection_id`. We were
doing this. However, we want the actual collection data on the search
result to represent the actual collection it's in (the trash). I added
the code to do this, a test to make sure it works as intended, and a
comment to explain what we're doing here and why.

* Refactor permission for trashed_from_collection_id

Noah pointed out that the logic of ""what collection do I check for
permissions"" was getting sprinkled into numerous places, and it felt a
little scary. In fact, there was a bug in the previous implementation.
If you selected a collection with `(t2/select [:model/Collection ...])`,
selecting a subset of columns, and *didn't* include the
`trashed_from_collection_id` in that set of columns, then called
`mi/can-write?` on the result, you'd get erroneous results.
Specifically, we'd return `nil` (representing the root collection).

I think this is a reasonable fix, though I'm pretty new to using fancy
multimethods with `derive` and such. But basically, I wanted a way to
annotate a model to say ""check these permissions using
`:trashed_from_collection_id` if the item is archived."" And in this
case, we'll throw an exception if `:trashed_from_collection_id` is not
present, just like we currently throw an exception if `:collection_id`
is not present when checking permissions the normal way.

* Move existing archived items to the trash (#42241)

Move everything that's archived directly to the trash. It's not ideal
because we're wiping out the existing collection structure, but the
existing Archive page also has no collection structure.

* lint fixes from rebase

* Fix backend tests (#42506)

`can_write` on collection items was wrong because we didn't have a
`trashed_from_collection_id` - the refactor to ensure we didn't make
that mistake worked! :tada:

* Add an /api/collections/trash endpoint (#42476)

This fetches the Trash in exactly the same way as if we'd fetched it
with `/api/collection/:id` with the Trash ID. I hadn't realized that the

* disables reordering columns in archived questions, disables modifying archived question name in question header, collection picker no longer defaults to archived item, keeps trashed collection from appearing collection picker search results, shops showing empty area in trashed dashboard info sidebar, disables uploading csvs to trashed collections

* impls pr feedback

* fix e2e failure

* Localize the name of the Trash (#42514)

There are at least two spots where we can't just rely on the
after-select hook, and select the collection name directly from the
database: the Search and Collection API.

In these cases we need to call `collection/maybe-localize-trash-name`,
which will localize the name if the passed Collection is the Trash
collection.

* Update migration IDs

Migration IDs need to be in order.

* Fix failing mariadb:latest test (#42608)

Hooooly cow. Glad to finally track this down. The issue was that
booleans come back from MariaDB as NON BOOLEANS, and clojure says 0 is
truthy, and together that makes for FUN TIMES.

We need to turn MariaDB's bits to booleans before we can work with them.

* Make Trash Usable: Add `can_restore` to API endpoints (#42654)

Rather than having two separate implementations of the `can_restore`
hydration for cards and dashboards, I set up automagic hydration for the
`trashed_from_collection_id`. Then the hydration method for
`can_restore` can just first hydrate `trashed_from_collection` and then
operate based on that.

* fix can_restore for collections trashed from root

* Fix `trashed_from_location` for trashed subcols

We were setting `trashed_from_location` on subcollections to the
`trashed_from_location` of the ancestor that was trashed - which is
wrong.

This would have caused bugs where collections would be restored to the
root collection, regardless of where they were originally trashed from.

* Fix Trash rollbacks (#42710)

* Fix Trash rollbacks

There were a few errors in my initial implementation.

First, we can't simply assume that `trashed_from_location` and
`trashed_from_collection_id` are set for anything in the archive. They
should be set for things *directly* trashed, but not for things trashed
as part of a collection.

Therefore, we need to set `location` and `collection_id` to something
like ""if the item is in the trash, then the `trashed_from` - otherwise,
don't modify it"".

Second, because `trashed_from_collection_id` is not a foreign key but
`collection_id` is, we have a potential problem. If someone upgrades,
Trashes a dashboard, then Trashes and permanently deletes the collection
that dashboard _was_ in, then downgrades, how do we move the dashboard
""back""? What do we set the dashboard's `collection_id` to?

The solution here is that when we downgrade, we don't actually move
dashboards, collections, or cards out of the Trash collection. Instead
we just make Trash a normal collection and leave everything in it.

* Make Trash Usable - Bug Bash 2 (#42787)

* wip

* fixes access to property on null value

* pr clean up

* more clean up

* Fix up tests

- permissions will check the archived from location. So recents need to
select :report_card.trashed_from_collection_id and
:dash.trashed_from_collection_id to satisfy mi/can-read?
- some commented out code with `(def wtf (mt/user-http-request
...))`. Restore tests.
- probably commented out because the recent views come back in an order
but we don't care about the order. And it was asserting against an
ordered collection. Just go from [{:id <id> :model <model>} ...] to a
map of {<id> <model>} and then our comparison works fine and is not
sensitive to order.

* put try/finally around read-only-mode

ensure the setting read-only-mode! to false happens in a finally
block. Also, set read-only-mode to false in

```clojure
(deftest read-only-login-test
  (try
    (cloud-migration/read-only-mode! true)
    (mt/client :post 200 ""session"" (mt/user->credentials :rasta))
    (finally
      (cloud-migration/read-only-mode! false))))
```

But worryingly, I think we have a lurking problem that I'm not sure why
we haven't hit yet. We run tests in parallel and then put all of the
non-parallel tests on the same main thread. And when one of these puts
the app in read-only-mode, the parallel tests will fail. HOPEFULLY since
they are parallel they won't be hitting the app-db necessarily, but
there could be lots of silly things that break.

John Swanson,johnswanson,2024-05-22 06:34:16+00:00,"Fix `report_card.collection_preview` in v49 (#42950)

This is a bit painful. I merged this change, but realized we need to
backport the fix to v49. However:

- we don't want to have two versions of the migration (one with a v49
id, one with a v50 id) because then if someone upgrades to 50, then
downgrades to 49, the `rollback` will run and change the type back,
leading to a bug.

- we don't want to push a v51 changeSet ID to v49 or v50, because we
give the user a helpful notice when their database needs a downgrade.
We do this by checking for the latest *executed* migration in the
database and comparing it to the latest migration that Liquibase knows
about, and making sure the executed isn't bigger than the known (e.g.
you can't have executed a v51 migration if it isn't in the local
migration yaml). That would all work fine, except that then we want to
tell you how to downgrade your database, and we use the latest-executed
version for that. So if, for example, someone upgraded from 48 to 49 and
got a v51 changeset, then downgraded back to 48, they would get an error
telling them to run the *v51* jar to roll back their DB.

In this case though, I think it's fine to just move the migration around
to v49, then we can backport it to 49 and 50."

* Allow disabling encryption for settings

For two settings, we want to disable encryption entirely.

On the way out of the data source, we don't need to worry - the
decryption is already backwards-compatible with non-encrypted data.

On the way in, things are a bit less straightforward. The core of the
change is replacing the `t2/deftransform` that *always* runs
`encryption/maybe-encrypt` on the value with:

- a define-after-select that always tries to decrypt the value (so we
can handle existing encrypted values in the db)

- a define-before-insert that encrypts the value if the `defsetting`
told us to, and

- a define-before-update that does the same thing.

For now, set two settings to be never-encrypted: `analytics-uuid` and
`anon-tracking-enabled`."

Braden Shepherdson,bshepherdson,2024-05-31 18:43:19+00:00,"[QP] Drop last stage aggregations for questions in chain filtering (#43274)

This drops the aggregation clauses and gets the possible values for the
